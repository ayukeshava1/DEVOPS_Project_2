# Design Guide for LiDAR-Camera Fusion Product

## Overview
This document provides a flowchart and CAD rough diagram description for building a real-time object detection product integrating LiDAR and camera for 360° coverage, designed to operate outdoors in extreme conditions (-40°C to +55°C, rain, snow, high sunshine). The product uses a single motherboard for compactness and is weatherproof (IP67).

## Flowchart for Building the Product

### Flowchart Description
- **Start**: Define goal—single, weatherproof product for real-time LiDAR-camera fusion with 360° coverage.
- **Step 1: Requirements Analysis**
  - Inputs: 360° FOV, 20–30 FPS, -40°C to +55°C, IP67.
  - Decision: Research vs. commercial? (Affects patents).
  - Output: Specification document (LiDAR: 64 channels, Camera: 1080p).
- **Step 2: Hardware Selection**
  - Tasks: Select Ouster OS1 ($15,000), 4 FLIR Blackfly S cameras ($4,000), NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier ($3,500).
  - Decision: Single motherboard for compactness.
  - Output: Bill of materials (~$22,100).
- **Step 3: Mechanical Design**
  - Tasks: Design IP67 enclosure (20x20x30 cm) in SolidWorks. Central LiDAR, 4 cameras at 90° intervals. Add heaters/fans.
  - Decision: Spinning LiDAR for 360°.
  - Output: CAD model.
- **Step 4: Electrical Design**
  - Tasks: Single motherboard with PCIe (LiDAR), CSI (cameras), FPGA for sync. Power: 12–24V.
  - Output: PCB schematic (KiCad).
- **Step 5: Calibration**
  - Tasks: Intrinsic (OpenCV for camera, manufacturer tools for LiDAR) and extrinsic (Kalibr, checkerboard) calibration.
  - Output: Calibration parameters (\( K \), \( T \)).
- **Step 6: Software Development**
  - Tasks: Preprocessing (PCL/OpenCV), feature extraction (PointNet++/ResNet), fusion (concatenation/attention), detection (RPN/YOLO).
  - Decision: Open-source (PyTorch, ROS2).
  - Output: Fusion model code.
- **Step 7: Integration**
  - Tasks: Assemble hardware, connect sensors to motherboard, install firmware, integrate with ROS2.
  - Output: Functional prototype.
- **Step 8: Testing**
  - Tasks: Simulate in CARLA, test on track, evaluate 3D mAP (KITTI). Verify weatherproofing (MIL-STD-810).
  - Decision: Performance acceptable? (If no, iterate).
  - Output: Test reports.
- **Step 9: Optimization**
  - Tasks: Optimize model (TensorRT, quantization) for 20–30 FPS. Add hydrophobic coatings, wipers.
  - Output: Optimized prototype.
- **Step 10: Deployment**
  - Tasks: Mount on vehicle/robot, stream to RViz, log performance.
  - Output: Deployed system.
- **Step 11: Maintenance and Scaling**
  - Tasks: Monitor hardware, update software, plan fleet deployment.
  - Output: Maintenance plan.
- **End**: Operational, weatherproof product.

## CAD Rough Diagram Description

### Overview
The CAD diagram describes a compact, cylindrical pod (20 cm diameter, 30 cm height, ~5 kg) integrating a LiDAR and four cameras for 360° coverage, with a single motherboard and weatherproof features for -40°C to +55°C, rain, snow, and high sunshine.

### Components and Layout
- **Shape**: Cylindrical aluminum pod with a transparent polycarbonate dome (IP67).
- **LiDAR**: Ouster OS1, centrally mounted at the top (10 cm diameter, 15 cm height), 360° horizontal FOV, ±45° vertical FOV. Spinning mechanism.
- **Cameras**: Four FLIR Blackfly S (1080p, 90° FOV), arranged in a ring (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°) at 20 cm height, 5 cm offset from LiDAR base.
- **Motherboard**: NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier (10x10 cm) at the base, with PCIe (LiDAR), CSI (cameras), and FPGA for sync.
- **Enclosure**: Aluminum body, 3 mm polycarbonate dome (UV-stabilized). Sealed gaskets, nitrogen-filled to prevent fogging.
- **Thermal Management**: PTC heater (50W) for -40°C, two 40 mm fans for +55°C, heat sinks on motherboard.
- **Weatherproofing**: Hydrophobic coating, micro-wiper system, Gore-Tex vents.
- **Mounting**: VESA-compatible base with M8 bolts, rubber isolators for vibration (10–50G).
- **Cabling**: Single M12 connector for power (12–24V) and data (Ethernet, 1 Gbps).

### Views
- **Top View**: Circular pod, LiDAR in center, four cameras at 90° intervals, transparent dome.
- **Side View**: LiDAR protrudes 10 cm, cameras at 20 cm, motherboard at base, cables via sealed port.
- **Cross-Section**: Shows wiring (PCIe, CSI), heater/fan placement, nitrogen-filled gaps.

### CAD Notes
- **Software**: Use SolidWorks/Fusion 360. Toler
